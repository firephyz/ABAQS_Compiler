Has one compartment, the SIM_SPACE. Represents the FPGA architecture space.
Each species is defined within this compartment. Additionally,
  each species is prefixed by either "CELL_" or "AUTO_" to represent that it
  is a cell or autoinducer respectively.
Required CELL_output parameter with respective rule. The space_agent uses this
  to know when to output more chemical.


Architectural Ideas
Ability for space_agent to detect not only the cell_state at its current location
  but also some additional data related to that cell. Stochastic variation in cell
  parameters for example.
