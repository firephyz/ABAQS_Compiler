Attempting to specify the subset of SBML we will support.
Spatial package is implemented and I can use it but it isn't yet well documented.
 - Spec is ambiguous in some specific cases and has no examples yet to help.
Analytic geometry or sampled field? Or both?
Should we support multiple domains?
 - If we are only targeting QS, then we really only have one domain right?
   The extracellular simulation space.
