3 main kinds of QS
  Gram Negative - AHL and luxI and luxR receptor pairs
  Gram Positive - AIP and the new ComRS
  Both - AI-2 is unique since it can be used for intra-species communication
AHL-Degrading Enzymes
Biological NOR gate using QS. (AHL signaler)

Attempting to specify the subset of SBML we will support.
Spatial package is implemented and I can use it but it isn't yet well documented.
 - Spec is ambiguous in some specific cases and has no examples yet to help.
Analytic geometry or sampled field? Or both?
Should we support multiple domains?
 - If we are only targeting QS, then we really only have one domain right?
   The extracellular simulation space.

Has one compartment, the SIM_SPACE. Represents the FPGA architecture space.
Each species is defined within this compartment. Additionally,
  each species is prefixed by either "CELL_" or "AUTO_" to represent that it
  is a cell or autoinducer respectively.
Required CELL_output parameter with respective rule. The space_agent uses this
  to know when to output more chemical.


Architectural Ideas
Ability for space_agent to detect not only the cell_state at its current location
  but also some additional data related to that cell. Stochastic variation in cell
  parameters for example.

Talk with Alan about input and output data formats for the entire
  architecture. I want to begin specifying some of the layout of the
  architecture file and it would be nice if that mirrored the input the
  architecture expects in some way.

TODO: Change check_valid_abaqs_doc to report all errors in document at once.
        Don't just stop after the first is encountered (as is currently done
        since we use exceptions).
TODO: Don't let uses specify attributes that we don't use. In the Species
        element for example.
